## Presentation

Happy is a very light http client like Postman or Insomnia.  It is made with Angular and Electron. It is light and fast. All data are stored locally and nothing is sent to servers. It is therefore anonymous.

## ⚡️ Installation

You can install the application by downloading the version of your choice in the Github releases of this project. As the application is not signed by a certificate, you will probably have to force the first opening of the application.
- On mac, right click on the application, open
